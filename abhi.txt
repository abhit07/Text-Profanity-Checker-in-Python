“Social content is extremely rich,” says the center’s director Amit P. Sheth. “The cursing issue is an expression of sentiment and emotion…it’s kind of a core issue of understanding the language.” The center is working on developing automated tools that could flag issues of worrisome harassment on social media, especially in high school and college years, or could identify depressive disorders or disposition to violence. Creating filters for kids on social media is also another potential application.
Of course, timing and context is everything, and not all cursing is negative. For example, “I f*$%-ing love you” could be music to the @ recipient’s ears.
